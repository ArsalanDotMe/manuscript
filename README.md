# Manuscript

Imagine that instead of pain-stakingly writing code to build backend APIs, you could just list down what you need in a document and have an implementor implement an API that does all what you asked.

Imagine defining your API once and have it run on any platform with an implementor. Define your API once, and launch it in any language or platform that has a manuscript implementor. Want to deploy your API on cheap hosting? Run your API on PHP. Need to get high performance only a fully compiled language can provide? Shift to a Go server instantly without a single change in code. 

It's called manuscript and it'll change how we create APIs forever.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. It is not done.

This repo comes with a sample manuscript, and an implementor written in node.js. The spec is very early stage and will change a lot in the coming times.

Currently, it requires a postgres database.
