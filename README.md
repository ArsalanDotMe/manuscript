# Manuscript

What if instead of pain-stakingly coding an API backend while having to chose the web framework, language, libraries etc, we could just describe the API and its routes as a set of operations that could be implemented by any language, any framework, using any set of libraries.

What if you could build an API free of bugs on the first try? What if instead of using a laptop or a desktop, you could build a custom API from your smartphone? What if you could just build your API once and it could get faster automatically as implementations improve performance?

I believe all of the above is possible and **manuscript** is my attempt to bring this dream to life. 

If this sounds awesome to you, help me build manuscript and let us change how we create APIs forever.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. It is not done.

This repo comes with a simple manuscript for a todos backend, and an implementor written in node.js. The spec is very early stage and will change a lot in the coming times.

Currently, it requires a postgres database.

## Instructions:

* Install `lab` globally.
* Clone this repo
* Navigate to the directory of this repo
* Do `npm install`
* Run `lab`
* Study `todos.json` in test folder.
